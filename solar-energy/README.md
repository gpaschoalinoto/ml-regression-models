# Solar Energy Output Predictor

The Solar Energy Output Predictor project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the power output of horizontal photovoltaic (PV) panels using weather and location data. By leveraging data from 12 Northern Hemisphere sites collected over 14 months, the project aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of solar energy forecasting, contributing to the broader adoption of renewable energy technologies.

## Overview

Horizontal photovoltaic panels are a crucial component of renewable energy systems, providing clean and sustainable electricity. Accurate power output predictions enable better grid management, optimized energy distribution, and informed decision-making for energy producers and consumers.

The dataset accompanying this project originates from the study *"Machine Learning Modeling of Horizontal Photovoltaics Using Weather and Location Data"*. It includes comprehensive information from 12 distinct sites, with the following features:

- **location:** Name or identifier of the site.
- **date:** The date of data collection.
- **time:** The specific time the data was recorded.
- **latitude:** The geographic latitude of the site.
- **longitude:** The geographic longitude of the site.
- **altitude:** The elevation of the site above sea level (in meters).
- **YRMODAHRMI:** The year, month, day, hour and minute of data collection.
- **month:** The month of data collection.
- **hour:** The hour of data collection.
- **season:** The meteorological season (e.g., winter, spring).
- **humidity:** The relative humidity level (percentage).
- **ambienttemp:** The air temperature (in Â°F).
- **polypwr:** The power output from the PV panel (in kilowatts), the prediction target.
- **wind.speed:** The wind speed at the site (in m/s).
- **visibility:** The visibility range (in meters).
- **pressure:** The atmospheric pressure (in hPa).
- **cloud.ceiling:** The height of the cloud ceiling above the ground (in meters).
